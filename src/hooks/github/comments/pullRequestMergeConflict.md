Hey, @{{pull.user.login}}, there's a merge conflict in your submission!

A merge conflict can happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. In order for a pull request to be merged, the conflict must first be resolved.

Fixing merge conflicts can be confusing the first time. Try to figure out [how to resolve a merge conflict](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/), and then open another pull request!

If you get really stuck, you can always delete your fork and try again.
