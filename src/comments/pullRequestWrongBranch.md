Thanks for the submission, @{{pull.user.login}}.

As mentioned in the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/danthareja/contribute-to-open-source/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#open-a-pull-request), I can only accept a pull request made to _your branch_.

This is a weird requirement, but it's necessary here in order to allow multiple people to contribute the same code. In the real world, most projects would expect you to open a Pull Request against the `master` base branch.

###### Want to contribute to the master branch? [Open an issue](https://github.com/danthareja/contribute-to-open-source-server/issues/new) in the partner repo and let's talk.
