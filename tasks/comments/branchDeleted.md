Hello again, @{{pull.user.login}}! I want to congratulate you again for completing this challenge. Hopefully you've started to get out there and apply your knowledge to another project.

Since you haven't pushed a commit in a while, I'm going to delete your branch in order to make room for others actively particiating. You'll still have access to your fork, but you won't be able to submit anymore pull requests to this branch.

Don't worry though! If you decide that you do want a new branch, you can [delete your fork](https://github.com/{{pull.user.login}}/contribute-to-open-source/settings) and re-fork the original project.

Happy Hacking!
