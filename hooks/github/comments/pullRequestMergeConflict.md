@{{pull.user.login}}, I have to close this pull request, there's a merge conflict in your submission :sob:

A merge conflict happens when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. In order for a pull request to be merged, the conflict must first be resolved.

Figure out how to resolve a merge conflict [from the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/), and then open another pull request!
