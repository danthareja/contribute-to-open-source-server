Thanks for the submission, @{{pull.user.login}}.

As mentioned in the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/danthareja/contribute-to-open-source/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#open-a-pull-request), I can only accept a pull request made to *your branch*. This behavior deviates from most projects (where a pull request to the master branch may be expected) in order to replicate this experience for multiple people.
