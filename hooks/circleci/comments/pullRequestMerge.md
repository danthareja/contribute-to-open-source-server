## :tada: You did it! :tada:

You're an open source contributor now! Whether this was your [first pull request](http://firstpr.me/), or you’re just looking for new ways to contribute, I hope you’re inspired to take action. Don't forget to say thanks when a maintainer puts effort into helping you, even if a contribution doesn't get accepted.

Remember, open source is made by people like you: one issue, pull request, comment, and +1 at a time.
